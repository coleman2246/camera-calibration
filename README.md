# Camera Calibration
The files in this repo can be used to determine the intrinsic properties matrix of a camera as well as distortion coefficents. To learn more about these parameters visit opencv's documentation [here].

## Before You Start
The code in the repo expects to be running on python 3.9.7 with opencv-python 4.5.3.56, but should work on other python 3.x.x versions .Print [this](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.4/doc/pattern.png) image on an 8.5x11 inch peice of paper.
